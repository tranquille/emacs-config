* Apperance
** Theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package spacemacs-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :init (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t))
#+end_src
** Look & Feel
*** Remove startup screen
We use an actual replacement for it, keep reading or head directly to [[dashboard]]
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC
*** disable menu 
If you like using any of those, change -1 to 1.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC
* Mac OS related
** fix some keys
On mac os the keybindgs a somehow messed up, without this settings we are not able to type a couple characters like braces. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mac-right-option-modifier nil)
#+END_SRC
* Git integration
Countless are the times where I opened ansi-term to use =git= on something.
These times are also something that I'd prefer stay in the past, since =magit= is
great. It's easy and intuitive to use, shows its options at a keypress and much more.
** magit
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC
