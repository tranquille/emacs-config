* Git integration
Countless are the times where I opened ansi-term to use =git= on something.
These times are also something that I'd prefer stay in the past, since =magit= is
great. It's easy and intuitive to use, shows its options at a keypress and much more.
** magit
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit)
#+END_SRC
